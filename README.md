- 👋 Hi, I’m @EventHor1zon
- 👀 I’m interested in: that special little boundary where hardware becomes software. Also space :) Cybernetics is cool too. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: 'Design Patterns for Object Oriented Software'! And FPGA/Verilog! And Digital Signal Processing! And Arm assembly! And PCB design! And software defined radio! And how to tell if you're taking on too much!
- 💞️ I’m looking to: collaborate on interesting projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: stretch!
